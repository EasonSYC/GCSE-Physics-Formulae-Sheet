    \section*{What is this and why this?}
        Most calculation error in GCSE Physics exams is caused by not knowing the formulae, not knowing the derived form and not knowing the meaning of the symbols. I made this document based on the CIE IGCSE Physics (9-1) Syllabus from 2023 onwards. I hope this could help with your IGCSE studies!

        I am also an IGCSE student so errors are inevitable in this document. Feel free to email \href{yicheng\_shao@oxcoll.com}{yicheng\_shao@oxcoll.com} to point out any mistakes or submit an issue on the GitHub page!

        P.S. I want to try my best to include quantitative formulae for qualitative requirements at GCSE, but they usually require more Mathematical tools so it is normal to have unexpected symbols.

        This is the simplified version with only the formulae you are required to use to calculate. Vector notations are still present just for the sake of science.

    \section{Mechanics}
        \subsection{Kinematics}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Definition of speed:}
                \[
                    v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(v\) stands for speed, \unit{\metre\per\second}; \(\Delta s\) stands for distance elapsed, \unit{\metre}; \(\Delta t\) stands for time elapsed, \unit{\second}.

                \WordExpl Speed equals distance covered per unit time.

                \DeriForm \(\Delta s = v \Delta t, t = \frac{\Delta s}{v}\).

                \Note Speed and distance are both scalars.

                \item \textbf{Definition of velocity:}
                \[
                    \vect{v} = \frac{\Delta \vect{s}}{\Delta t}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\vect{v}\) stands for velocity, \unit{\metre\per\second}; \(\Delta \vect{s}\) stands for displacement, \unit{\metre}; \(\Delta t\) stands for time elapsed, \unit{\second}.

                \item \textbf{Definition of average speed:}
                \[
                    \bar{v} = \frac{s}{t}
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\bar{v}\) stands for average speed, \unit{\metre\per\second}; \(s\) stands for distance, \unit{\metre}; \(t\) stands for time, \unit{\second}.

                \WordExpl Average speed equals the total distance over total time.

                \DeriForm \(s = \bar{v}t, t = \frac{s}{\bar{v}}\).

                \Note Difference between average speed and speed: one is over a period, another is at a certain time.

                \item \textbf{Definition of acceleration:}
                \[
                    \vect{a} = \frac{\Delta \vect{v}}{\Delta t}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\vect{a}\) stands for acceleration, \unit{\metre\per\second\squared}; \(\Delta \vect{v}\) stands for change in velocity, \unit{\metre\per\second}; \(\Delta t\) stands for time elapsed, \unit{\second}.

                \WordExpl Acceleration is the rate of change in velocity.

                \DeriForm \(\Delta \vect{v} = \Delta t \vect{a}, \Delta t = \frac{\Delta \vect{v}}{\vect{a}}\),
                \[
                    \vect{v} = \vect{v_0} + \vect{a}t
                \]

                \Note Acceleration is (usually) a vector.

            \end{enumerate}

            \textbf{You are not expected to know the \(suvat\) equation, but please draw a \(\vect{v}-t\) graph if necessary.}

        \subsection{Statics and Energy}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Weight:}
                \[
                    \vect{W} = m \vect{g}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\vect{W}\) stands for the weight (a force), \unit{\newton}; \(m\) stands for mass, \unit{\kilogram}; \(\vect{g}\) stands for gravitational acceleration or gravitational field strength, \unit{\metre\per\second\squared} or \unit{\newton\per\kilogram}.

                \WordExpl The gravitational acceleration is the gravitational force (weight) per unit time (and equivalent to gravitational acceleration).

                \DeriForm \(\vect{g} = \frac{\vect{W}}{m}, m = \frac{\vect{W}}{\vect{g}}\).

                \Note Weight and gravitational acceleration/gravitational field strength are both vectors.

                \item \textbf{Density:}
                \[
                    \rho = \frac{m}{V}
                \]

                \WordExpl The density is mass per unit volume.

                \DeriForm \(m = \rho V, V = \frac{\rho}{m}\).

                \Note Density is a scalar, and it is a property of a material (usually), which could also determine floating and sinking.
                
                \item \textbf{Definition of pressure (General):}
                \[
                    p = \frac{F}{A}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(p\) stands for pressure, \unit{\pascal} or \unit{\newton\per\metre\squared}; \(F\) stands for the magnitude of the normal force, \unit{\newton}; \(A\) stands for area, \unit{\metre\squared}.

                \WordExpl Pressure is the magnitude of the force exerted per unit area.

                \DeriForm \(F = pA, A = \frac{F}{p}\).

                \Note Though force is a vector, pressure is a scalar. This will be more significant in the next formula.

                \item \textbf{Pressure (Liquid and Prism):}
                \[
                    \Delta p = \rho g \Delta h.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\Delta p\) stands for change in pressure, \unit{\pascal}; \(\rho\) stands for the density, \unit{\kilogram\per\metre\cubed}; \(g\) stands for gravitational acceleration, \unit{\newton \per \kilogram}; \(\Delta h\) stands for difference in depth/height, \unit{\metre}.

                \WordExpl The change in the pressure (over a depth) is the gravitational acceleration times the density times the change in depth.

                \DeriForm \(\rho = \frac{\Delta p}{g \Delta h}, \Delta h = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho g}\).

                \Note Pressure is exerted in all directions in the liquid.

                \item \textbf{Definition of work:}
                \[
                    W = \Delta E = \vect{F} \cdot \vect{d} = Fd \cos \theta.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(W\) stands for work, \unit{\joule} or \unit{\newton \metre}; \(\Delta E\) stands for change in energy, \unit{\joule}; \(\vect{F}\) stands for force, \unit{\newton}; \(\vect{d}\) stands for displacement, \unit{\metre}; \(\theta\) stands for the angle between the force and the direction of travel, \unit{\degree} or \unit{\radian} (note that radians just a dimension of 1).

                \WordExpl Work is energy transferred. Work is the force times distance travelled in the direction of the force.

                \DeriForm \(F = \frac{W}{d \cos \theta}, d = \frac{W}{F \cos \theta}\).

                \Note Usually the \(\cos \theta\) can be ignored, but please remember the distance travelled in the direction of the force.

                \item \textbf{Kinetic energy:}
                \[
                    E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(E_k\) stands for kinetic energy, \unit{\joule}; \(m\) stands for mass, \unit{\kilogram}; \(v\) stands for speed or magnitude of velocity, \unit{\metre\per\second}.

                \WordExpl The kinetic energy is half the mass times energy squared.
                
                \DeriForm \(v = \sqrt{\frac{2 E_k}{m}}\).

                \Note Energy is always a scalar. It makes no difference using speed or dot product of velocity here. Note that \(\Delta E_k \neq \frac{1}{2} m \Delta v^2\).

                \item \textbf{Gravitational potential energy (in a uniform gravitational field):}
                \[
                    \Delta E_p = m g \Delta h.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(E_p\) stands for gravitational potential energy, \unit{\joule}; \(m\) stands for mass, \unit{\kilogram}; \(g\) stands for gravitational acceleration (magnitude), \unit{\metre\per\second\squared}; \(\Delta h\) stands for change in height, \unit{\metre}.

                \WordExpl The change in gravitational potential energy is the mass times the gravitational field strength times the change in the height.

                \DeriForm \(m = \frac{\Delta E_p}{g \Delta h}, g = \frac{\Delta E_p}{m \Delta h}, \Delta h = \frac{\Delta E_p}{mg} = \frac{\Delta E_p}{W}, E_p = W \Delta h\).

                \Note This formula only holds in a uniform gravitational field, there is another one in more complex gravitational fields (e.g. Newtonian Gravity and Einstein's General Relativity).

                \item \textbf{Definition of power:}
                \[
                    P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(P\) stands for power, \unit{\watt} or \unit{\joule\per\second}; \(\Delta E\) stands for energy transferred \(= W\), \unit{\joule}; \(\Delta t\) stands for time elapsed, \unit{\second}.

                \WordExpl Power is the rate of energy transferred.

                \DeriForm \(P = \frac{W}{\Delta t}, \Delta E = W = P \Delta t, t = \frac{W}{P} = \frac{\Delta E}{P}\),
                \[
                    P = \vect{F} \cdot \vect{v}.
                \]

                \Note This formula also works for electrical power.

                \item \textbf{Efficiency:}
                \[
                    \eta = \frac{P_{\text{useful}}}{P_{\text{total}}}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\eta\) stands for efficiency, dimension of \(1\) without unit; \(P_{\text{useful}}\) stands for useful power (output), \unit{\watt}; \(P_{\text{total}}\) stands for total power (input), \unit{\watt}.

                \WordExpl The efficiency is the percentage/proportion of useful energy/power output to the total energy/power input.

                \DeriForm
                \[
                    \eta = \frac{W_{\text{useful}}}{W_{\text{total}}}.
                \]

                \Note You can times \(100\%\) which is basically \(1\) to get a percentage.

            \end{enumerate}

        \subsection{Effect of Forces}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Definition of momentum:}
                \[
                    \vect{p} = m\vect{v}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\vect{p}\) stands for momentum, \unit{\kilogram \metre \per \second}; \(m\) stands for mass, \unit{\kilogram}; \(\vect{v}\) stands for velocity, \unit{\metre\per\second}.

                \WordExpl Momentum is the product of mass and its velocity.

                \DeriForm \(m = \frac{\vect{p}}{\vect{v}}, \vect{v} = \frac{\vect{p}}{m}\).

                \Note Momentum itself is a vector and has a direction.
                
                \item \textbf{Newton's 2nd Law:}
                \[
                    \vect{F} = \frac{\Delta \vect{p}}{\Delta t}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\vect{F}\) stands for force, \unit{\newton}; \(\Delta \vect{p}\) stands for change in momentum, \unit{\kilogram \metre \per \second}; \(\Delta t\) stands for time elapsed, \unit{\second}.

                \WordExpl Force is equal to the rate of change in momentum.

                \DeriForm \(\Delta \vect{p} = \vect{F} \Delta t, \Delta t = \frac{\Delta \vect{p}}{\vect{F}}\),
                \[
                    \vect{F} = m \vect{a}.
                \]

                \Note This is a very important equation in physics, and it could lead to discussions about inertial mass/gravitational mass, Lagrange -- d'Almbert's Principle (turning non-inertial frames into inertial ones), special relativity, etc.

                \item \textbf{Impulse:}
                \[
                    \vect{I} = \Delta \vect{p}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\vect{I}\) stands for impulse, \unit{\kilogram \metre \per \second}; \(\Delta \vect{p}\) stands for change in momentum, \unit{\kilogram \metre \per \second}.

                \WordExpl Impulse is equal to the change in momentum.

                \DeriForm The following is derived from Newton's 2nd Law:
                \[
                    \vect{I} = \vect{F} \Delta t.
                \]

                \Note This is only meaningful if momentum is conserved - just like work and energy.

                \item \textbf{Moment:}
                \[
                    \vect{M} = \vect{r} \times \vect{F}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\vect{M}\) stands for the moment (of a force), \unit{\newton \metre} (according to SI standards, we don't write it as a \unit{\joule}); \(\vect{r}\) stands for the position vector of the force, \unit{\metre}; \(\vect{F}\) stands for the force, \unit{\newton}.

                \WordExpl The magnitude of the moment of a force is equal to the magnitude of the force times the perpendicular distance between the pivot and the line of action of the force.

                \DeriForm To be simple, denote \(d\) as the perpendicular distance between the pivot and the line of action of the force, \unit{\metre}, then we have \(M = Fd, F = \frac{M}{d}, d = \frac{M}{F}\).

                \Note I wrote this in terms of vector and their cross-product just for the sake of science but this is not required at all.

                \item \textbf{Hooke's Law:}
                \[
                    \vect{F} = k \vect{x}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\vect{F}\) stands for force, \unit{\newton}; \(k\) stands for the spring constant, \unit{\newton \per \metre}; \(\vect{x}\) stands for the extension (vector).

                \WordExpl The force to extend or compress a spring (within the limit of linearity) is perpendicular to the extension.

                \DeriForm \(k = \frac{\vect{F}}{\vect{x}}, \vect{x} = \frac{\vect{F}}{k}\).

                \Note Remember to use extension for the \(\vect{x}\) not the total length.
            \end{enumerate}

    \section{Thermal Physics}
        \subsection{Ideal Gas}
            \textbf{Boyle's Law:}
            \[
                pV = \mathrm{const.}
            \]

            \MeanSymb \(p\) stands for pressure, \unit{\pascal}; \(V\) stands for volume, \unit{\metre \cubed}.

            \WordExpl The pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume given that its temperature remains the same.

            \DeriForm \(p_1 V_1 = p_2 V_2\).

            \Note This only remains true if the temperature is constant.

        \subsection{Temperature}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Conversion between kelvin and degree celsius:}
                \[
                    T \unit{\per \kelvin} = \theta \unit{\per \degreeCelsius} + 273(.15).
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(T\) stands for (thermodynamic) temperature in kelvin, \unit{\kelvin}; \(\theta\) stands for temperature in degrees Celsius, \unit{\degreeCelsius}.

                \WordExpl The temperature in kelvin is equal to the temperature in degrees Celsius plus \(273.15\).

                \DeriForm \(\theta \unit{\per \degreeCelsius} = T \unit{\per \kelvin} - 273(.15)\).

                \Note Please note that in all the ideal gas equations you need to use the thermodynamic temperature, but in the following equation you do not need to convert, as the change in one degree Celsius equals the change in one kelvin.

                \item \textbf{Thermal capacity:}
                \[
                    Q = m c \Delta T.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(Q\) stands for thermal energy transferred, \unit{\joule}; \(m\) stands for mass, \unit{\kilogram}; \(c\) stands for thermal capacity, \unit{\joule \per \kilogram \per \kelvin} or \unit{\joule \per \kilogram \per \degreeCelsius}; \(\Delta T\) stands for change in temperature, \unit{\kelvin} or \unit{\degreeCelsius}.

                \WordExpl The thermal capacity is defined as the heat energy transferred per unit mass per unit change in temperature.

                \DeriForm \(m = \frac{Q}{c \Delta T}, c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T}, \Delta T = \frac{Q}{mc}\).

                \Note Thermal capacity is a property of a material. It doesn't matter whether you calculate with degrees Celsius or kelvin, but make sure you use the same unit to calculate the temperature change.
                
            \end{enumerate}

    \section{Waves}
        \subsection{Waves}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Frequency and Period:}
                \[
                    f = \frac{1}{T}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(f\) stands for the frequency, \unit{\hertz} or \unit{\per \second}; \(T\) stands for the period, \unit{\second}.

                \WordExpl Frequency is the reciprocal of the period.

                \DeriForm \(fT = 1, T = \frac{1}{f}\).

                \Note This is true for all waves.

                \item \textbf{The wave equation:}
                \[
                    v = f \lambda.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(v\) stands for the wave speed, \unit{\metre \per \second}; \(f\) stands for the frequency, \unit{\hertz}; \(\lambda\) stands for the wavelength, \unit{\metre}.

                \WordExpl The wave speed of a wave is equal to its frequency times its wavelength.

                \DeriForm \(f = \frac{v}{\lambda}, \lambda = \frac{v}{f}\).

                \Note The frequency of a wave will not change (Doppler Effect! but that's an observation), so usually we can just say \(\lambda \propto v\).
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsection{Optics}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Refractive index:}
                \[
                    n = \frac{c}{v}
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(n\) stands for the refractive index, dimension of \(1\); \(c\) stands for the speed of light in vacuum, \(c = \qty{3.00 e 8}{\metre \per \second}\); \(v\) stands for the speed of light in that certain medium.

                \WordExpl The refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in that certain medium.

                \DeriForm \(c = nv, v = \frac{c}{n}\).

                \Note As the speed of light in a vacuum is the fastest thing in the world (special relativity!), \(n\) is always no smaller than one i.e. \(n \geq 1\) and \(n = 1\) iff. the medium is a vacuum. For simplicity we take \(n_{\text{air}} = 1\).
                
                \item \textbf{Snell's law:}
                \[
                    n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(n_1\) stands for the refractive index in the first medium, dimension of \(1\); \(\theta_1\) stands for the angle between the incident ray and the normal (i.e. incidence angle), \(\degree\); \(n_2\) stands for the refractive index in the second medium, dimension of \(1\); \(\theta_2\) stands for the angle between the refracted ray and the normal (i.e. refraction angle), \(\degree\).

                \WordExpl The product of the refractive index and the angle between the ray and the normal is the same while the light is refracting.

                \DeriForm \(\theta_2 = \arcsin \frac{n_1 \sin \theta 1}{n_2}, n_2 = \frac{n_1 \sin \theta_1}{\sin\theta_2}\).

                \Note This can be derived from Fermat's Principle, or maybe, least action principle!
                
                \item \textbf{Critical angle:}
                \[
                    \sin c = \frac{n_{\text{quick}}}{n_{\text{slow}}}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(c\) stands for the critical angle, \(\degree\); \(n_{\text{quick}}\) stands for the refractive index in the quick medium, dimension of \(1\); \(n_{\text{slow}}\) stands for the refractive index in the slow medium, dimension of \(1\).

                \WordExpl The sine of the critical angle is equal to the ratio between the refractive index of the fast medium and the slow medium.

                \DeriForm \(n_{\text{slow}} = \frac{n_{\text{quick}}}{\sin c}\).

                \Note This is a special case of the general Snell's law where a \(\theta\) equals \(90 \degree\). We see \(\sin c = \frac{1}{n}\) as we take the quick \(n_{\text{quick}}\) as \(1\) (in the case of air).
            \end{enumerate}

    \section{Electricity}
        \subsection{Electrical Quantities}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Definition of electromotive force (e.m.f.):}
                \[
                    E = \frac{W}{Q}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(E\) stands for the e.m.f., \unit{\volt} or \unit{\joule\per\coulomb}; \(W\) stands for work, \unit{\joule}; \(Q\) stands for charge, \unit{\coulomb}.

                \WordExpl The e.m.f. is equal to the electrical work done per unit charge to move it around a circuit.

                \DeriForm \(W = EQ, Q = \frac{W}{E}\).

                \Note The e.m.f. is not electromagnetic force, it is electromotive force! But not a force.

                \item \textbf{Definition of potential difference (p.d.):}
                \[
                    V = \frac{W}{Q}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(V\) stands for the p.d., \unit{\volt} or \unit{\joule\per\coulomb}; \(W\) stands for work, \unit{\joule}

                \WordExpl The p.d. is the work done per unit charge passing through an electric component.

                \DeriForm \(W = VQ, Q = \frac{W}{V}\).

                \Note The p.d. is effectively the same with e.m.f. -- but e.m.f. is converting other forms of energy into electrical energy while p.d. is the other way round.

                \item \textbf{Definition of current:}
                \[
                    I = \frac{Q}{t}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(I\) stands for the current, \unit{\ampere} or \unit{\coulomb\per\second}; \(Q\) stands for the charge, \unit{\coulomb}; \(t\) stands for time, \unit{\second}.

                \WordExpl The current is the charge flowing through a point per unit time. (Technically it should be \(\Delta Q\) and \(\Delta t\) but we don't mind here.)

                \DeriForm \(Q = It, t = \frac{Q}{I}\).

                \Note We don't care about \(I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\) because we only study constant current at this stage. Current is \textbf{not} a vector, but current density is (we don't need to know that yet but just FYI.)

                \item \textbf{Formula for electrical work and electrical power:}
                \[
                    P = VI, W = Pt = VIt = VQ.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(P\) stands for power, \unit{\watt}; \(V\) stands for voltage, \unit{\volt}; \(I\) stands for current, \unit{\ampere}; \(W\) stands for work, \unit{\joule}; \(t\) stands for time, \unit{\second}.

                \WordExpl The electrical power is equal to the voltage times the current; the electrical work done is equal to the voltage times the current times the time elapsed, which is also equal to the voltage times the charge.

                \DeriForm \(V = \frac{P}{I}, I = \frac{P}{V}\).

                \Note These are derived formulae from the definition of work and the definition of the current so it shouldn't be surprising if these are true. We will see an updated version of these in the next section.
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsection{Circuits}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Ohm's Law and Definition of Resistance:} (simplified version)
                \[
                    R = \frac{V}{I}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(R\) stands for resistance, \unit{\ohm} or \unit{\volt\per\ampere}; \(V\) stands for voltage (usually p.d.), \unit{\volt}; \(I\) stands for current, \unit{\ampere}.

                \WordExpl The resistance of an electrical component is the potential difference across it over the current passing through it.

                \DeriForm \(V = RI, I = \frac{V}{R}\).

                \Note This is a very important thing in electrical circuit calculation -- please remember this as it links some of the most important quantities together. Note that \(R \neq \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta I}\) which means resistance is not a gradient at a point!

                \item \textbf{More Power:}
                \[
                    P = VI = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(P\) stands for electrical power, \unit{\watt}; \(V\) stands for voltage, \unit{\volt}; \(I\) stands for current, \unit{\ampere}; \(R\) stands for resistance, \unit{\ohm}.

                \WordExpl The power is the product of the square of current and the resistance, which is equal to the square of voltage over the resistance.

                \DeriForm Too many.

                \Note This is a direct corollary of Ohm's Law.

                \item \textbf{Kirchoff's First Law:}
                \[
                    \sum I_{\text{in}} = \sum I_{\text{out}}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(\sum\) stands for the sum; \(I_{\text{in}}\) stands for the current flowing into a junction, \unit{\ampere}; \(I_{\text{out}}\) stands for the current flowing out a junction, \unit{\ampere}.

                \WordExpl The current flowing into a junction is equal to the current flowing out of a junction.

                \DeriForm The parallel circuit law (which will appear later).

                \Note This is a direct corollary from the conservation of charge.

                \item \textbf{Parallel Circuit Laws:}
                \begin{align*}
                    I &= I_1 + I_2 + \cdots + I_n,\\
                    V &= V_1 = V_2 = \cdots + V_n,\\
                    \frac{1}{R} &= \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n}.
                \end{align*}

                \MeanSymb \(I\) stands for the total current, \unit{\ampere}; \(I_i\) stands for the current passing through the \(i\)th component, \unit{\ampere}; \(V\) stands for the e.m.f., \unit{\volt}; \(V_i\) stands for the p.d. over the \(i\)th component, \unit{\volt}; \(R\) stands for the total resultant resistance, \unit{\ohm}; \(R_i\) stands for the resistance of the \(i\)th component, \unit{\ohm}.

                \WordExpl The total current in a parallel circuit is the sum of all the current in each branch; the e.m.f. of the parallel circuit is equal to the p.d. over each component; the resistance of the circuit is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocal of the resistances.

                \DeriForm Too many.

                \Note The p.d. and the e.m.f. are the same, as you are effectively measuring the same thing. The result of the current follows from the Kirchoff's Current Law and the resistance formula follows.

                \item \textbf{Series Circuit Laws:}
                \begin{align*}
                    I &= I_1 = I_2 = \cdots = I_n,\\
                    V &= V_1 + V_2 + \cdots + V_n,\\
                    R &= R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n.
                \end{align*}

                \MeanSymb \(I\) stands for the total current, \unit{\ampere}; \(I_i\) stands for the current passing through the \(i\)th component, \unit{\ampere}; \(V\) stands for the e.m.f., \unit{\volt}; \(V_i\) stands for the p.d. over the \(i\)th component, \unit{\volt}; \(R\) stands for the total resultant resistance, \unit{\ohm}; \(R_i\) stands for the resistance of the \(i\)th component, \unit{\ohm}.

                \WordExpl The current in a series circuit is all the same; the e.m.f. in a series circuit is the sum of the p.d.s of the components; the resistance of a series circuit is the sum of each component's resistance.

                \DeriForm Potential divider:
                \[
                    V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \cdot \frac{R_{\text{output}}}{R_{\text{total}}}.
                \]

                \Note The current law follows from Kirchoff's Current Law and the voltage follows from the Voltage Law, the resistance result is a corollary of them.
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsection{Electromagnetism}
            \textbf{Transformer:}
            \[
                \frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_2}.
            \]
            \MeanSymb \(V_1\) stands for the primary coil voltage, \unit{\volt}; \(V_2\) stands for the secondary coil voltage, \unit{\volt}; \(N_1\) stands for the number of coils on the primary coil, dimensionless; \(N_2\) stands for the number of coils on the secondary coil, dimensionless.

            \WordExpl The coil voltage is proportional to the number of coils on that respective coil.

            \DeriForm By conservation of energy,
            \[
                I_1 N_1 = I_2 N_2.
            \]

            \Note This is a very simple equation, so don't get it wrong! Be careful with the corresponding primary and secondary.

    \section{Space Physics}
        \subsection{Orbits}
            \textbf{The orbit period:}
            \[
                T = \frac{2 \pi r}{v}.
            \]

            \MeanSymb \(T\) stands for the orbit period, \unit{\second}; \(r\) stands for the orbit radius, \unit{\metre}; \(v\) stands for the orbit speed, \unit{\metre\per\second}.

            \WordExpl The orbit period is the circumference of the orbit over the orbit speed (trivial).

            \DeriForm \(v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}, r = \frac{Tv}{2\pi}\).

            \Note This can be used to derive the escape velocity (together with Newton's Law of Gravity).

        \subsection{Hubble's Constant}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{The Hubble's Constant:}
                \[
                    H_0 = \frac{v}{d}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(H_0\) stands for the Hubble Constant, \(H_0 \approx \qty{2.2 e -18}{\per \second}\); \(v\) stands for the receding velocity, \unit{\metre\per\second}; \(d\) stands for the distance, \unit{\metre}.

                \WordExpl The Hubble Constant is defined as the ratio of the speed at which the galaxy is moving away from the Earth to its distance from the Earth.

                \DeriForm \(v = H_0 d, d = \frac{v}{H_0}\).

                \Note According to the syllabus, you need to know the approximate value of the Hubble Constant.

                \item \textbf{Edge of Time:}
                \[
                    t = \frac{1}{H_0}.
                \]

                \MeanSymb \(t\) stands for the age of the universe, \unit{\second}, \(H_0\) stands for the Hubble Constant, \unit{\per\second}.

                \WordExpl The Hubble Constant is equal to the reciprocal of the age of the universe.

                \DeriForm Not really, but \(t H_0 = 1\).

                \Note \(t \approx \qty{1.38 e 10}{\mathrm{yr}}\).
            \end{enumerate}
