# GCSE-Physics-Formulae-Sheet
 Formulae Cheat Sheet for CIE IGCSE Physics (9-1) from 2023.

 Most calculation error in GCSE Physics exams is caused by not knowing the formulae, not knowing the derived form and not knowing the meaning of the symbols. I made this document based on the CIE IGCSE Physics (9-1) Syllabus from 2023 onwards. I hope this could help with your IGCSE studies!

 I am also an IGCSE student so errors are inevitable in this document. Feel free to email \href{eason.syc@icloud.com}{eason.syc@icloud.com} to point out any mistakes or submit an issue on the GitHub page!

 P.S. I want to try my best to include quantitative formulae for qualitative requirements at GCSE, but they usually require more Mathematical tools so it is normal to have unexpected symbols.
